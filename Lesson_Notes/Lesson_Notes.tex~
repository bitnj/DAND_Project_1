\section{Lesson 1 Notes}
  independent variable is the predictor
  dependent variable is the outcome 

  Correlation does not prove Causation

  Show Relationships then use Observational Studies / Surveys
  Show Causation requires a Controlled Experiment

  Benefits of Surveys
  Easy way to get information on a population
  Relatively inexpensive
  Can be conducted remotely
  Anyone can access and analyze results

  Downsides of Surveys
  Untruthful responses
  Biased responses
  Respondents not understanding the question (response bias)
  Respondents refusing to answer (non-response bias)


  Controlled Experiment
  Blinding - participant not told which treatment (actual or palcebo) they are receiving
  control group receives placebo
  Double Blind - researchers do not know which treatment participants received
  
\section{Lesson 3 Notes}

population mean = \(\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{x_i}{N}\)
sample mean = \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{x_i}{n}\)
where N = population size
and n = sample size

\section{Lesson 4 Notes}
a data point is an outlier if it is less than Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
or greater than Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
where IQR is the inter-quartile range

variance
\(\Sigma \frac{(x - \bar{x})^2}{n}\)

\section{Lesson 5 and 6 Notes}
z score for a population
\( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\) 

\section{Lesson 7 Notes}

Standard Error
\( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\)
where n = sample size

\section{Lesson 8 Notes}
z score for a sample mean\\
\( z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}} \)\\
95\% of sample means will fall within \( \frac{1.96\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \)\\
\( \bar{x} \pm \frac{1.96\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \) is a 95\% confidence interval around the sample mean

\section{Lesson 9 Notes}
alpha levels\\
\( \alpha = .05 \)\\
\( \alpha = .01 \)\\
\( \alpha = .001 \)\\
